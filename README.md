# TL;DR: Don't waste your time here!
This is a prank for a young, naughty little boy who thinks he can paint. So, we've put his "mess-terpieces" online for anyone who wants to buy them.

We'd like to express our gratitude to [Sal](https://www.wowthemes.net), the developer of the [Pintereso theme](https://wowthemesnet.github.io/template-pintereso-bootstrap-jekyll/), as well as the maintainers of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for making it easy for us to create this site."
